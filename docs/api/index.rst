.. rubric:: Open-source Python library for graph databases.
.. snippet:: social

Bulbs supports pluggable backends and currently has bindings for `Neo4j Server <http://neo4j.org/>`_  and `Rexster <http://rexster.tinkerpop.com/>`_. 

Rexster is the Blueprints server and so this means Bulbs supports any Blueprints-enabled graph database, including: Neo4j, InfiniteGraph, OrientDB, Dex, TinkerGraph, and OpenRDF Sail.
